DONE
need +3/4mm on bottom of air tower to stand correctly
- add this on the flip down of the tower part

-zip tie hooks for cables
increased slider hole height by 0.5mm for tolerance and closer fit

consider hard restricting slider when extending
- screw on stopper?

make slider 0.5mm thinner for sliding tolerance

add brim for easier hook printing
chamfer the air_tower magnet area to make it printable

fix slide colliding with top acrylic

make air tower nut holes deeper to accommodate m3x15

fixed ir led holes from 6/5/5/5/5/6 to 5.5
chamfer top_2 to make printable

increase slider nut insert height 2.5->3
thin out air_2 except for nut area
increase cable channel height for easier passthrough

increase m3 hole for hinges to help threading
